     <h2>Welcome to School World Investment Website</h2>
        <acticle>
              
                School World Investment Limited started in 2005 inspired by Nkem Raji and Grace Achike whose love of travel expanded to the                 realisation that most kids end up spending a three months vacation just shopping, watching Tv and going to Macdonald's or                   KFC; when kids were asked to describe their vacation, they couldn't write about the historical key landmarks. The museums                   were never a go area in the holiday plan. We decided, knowing that travelling was an adventure waiting to be explored and                   each child being part of this world of experience deserves to have a meaningful educative tour while having fun at the same                 time. 
                <br /><br />
                Lastly, it is not just taking the sound, site and curriculum from their classroom and bring the subject to life that matter                 only, it is the bond of friendship they make by learning to create and set boundaries that will mould that creativity and                   dream to be the very best of who they want to be. <br /><br />We look forward to having you go on tour with us.<br /><br />
